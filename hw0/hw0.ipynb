    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to give you a quick overview of some of the concepts and ideas that you should be familiar with _prior_ to taking this course.  The assignment will require you to build a basic softmax regression algorithm, plus a simple two-layer neural network.  You will create these implementations both in native Python (using the numpy library), and (for softmax regression) in native C/C++.  The homework will also walk you through the process of submitting your assignments to our autograding system. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the code development for the homeworks in 10-714 can be done in the Google Colab environment.  However, instead of making extensive use of actual code blocks within a colab notebook, most of the code you develop will be done `.py` files downloaded (automatically) to your Google Drive, and you will largely use the notebook for running shell scripts that test and submit the code to the auto-grader.  This is a somewhat non-standard usage of Colab Notebooks."

These _are_ just the standard backpropagation equations for a two-layer ReLU network: the $Z_1$ term just computes the \"forward\" pass while the $G_2$ and $G_1$ terms denote the backward pass.  But the precise form of the updates can vary depending upon the notation you've used for neural networks, the precise ways you formulate the losses, if you've derived these previously in matrix form, etc.  If the notation seems like it might be familiar from when you've seen deep networks in the past, and makes more sense after the 9/8 lecture, that is more than sufficient in terms of background (after all, the whole _point_ of deep learning systems, to some extent, is that we don't need to bother with these manual calculations).  But if these entire concepts are _completely_ foreign to you, then it may be better to take a separate course on ML and neural networks prior to this course, or at least be aware that there will be substantial catch-up work to do for the course.\n",

    "Using these gradients, now write the `nn_epoch()` function in the `src/simple_ml.py` file.  As with the previous question, your solution should modify the `W1` and `W2` arrays in place.  After implementing the function, run the following test.  Be sure to use matrix operations as indicated by the expresssions above to implement the function: this will be _much_ faster, and more efficient, than attempting to use loops (and it requires far less code)."

Although there are other alternatives, pybind11 library is relatively nice as an interface, as it is a header-only library, and allows you to implement the entire Python/C++ interface within a single C++ source library.\n",

Specifically, `X`, `y`, and `theta` are pointers to the raw data of the corresponding numpy arrays from the previous section.  We also assuming there is no padding in the data; that is, the second row begins immediately after the first row, with no additional bytes added, e.g., to align the memory to a certain boundary (all these issues will be mentioned in subsequent discussion in the course, but avoided for now). Of course, because only the raw data is passed into the function, in order to know the actual sizes of the underlying matrices, we also need to pass these sizes explicitly to the function, which is what is provided by the `m`, `n`, and `k` arguments.\n",

    "As expected, the numbers match exactly our Python version, and the code is ... about 5 times slower?!  What is going on here?  Well, it turns out that the \"manual\" matrix multiplication code you probably wrote for the C++ version is extremely inefficient.  While Python itself is a slow, interpreted language, numpy itself is backed by matrix multiplications written in C (or, more likely, Fortran, believe it or not), that have been highly optmized to make use of vector operations, the cache hierarchy of different processors, and other features that are essential for efficient numerical operations.  We will cover these details much more in later lectures, and you'll even write a matrix library that can actually perform these operations relatively efficiently (at least for some special cases ... it's honestly not that easy to beat numpy in general)."
